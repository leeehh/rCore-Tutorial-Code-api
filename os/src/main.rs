//! Bare-metal Rust entry point for the chapter 1 API exercise.

//! The provided assembly entry sets the stack pointer before calling

//! attributes, linker-symbol declarations, and all supporting implementations.
//!
//! No host runtime initializes this program. [`clear_bss()`] establishes zeroed
//! global storage; console output uses the provided SBI wrapper. Successful
//! execution ends through the board's QEMU exit device rather than returning.
