//! Mutexes for the chapter 8 API exercise.
//!
//! Keep the provided types, signatures, constructors, and resource accessors.
//! The four TODOs implement yielding and blocking mutexes, including resource
//! accounting. Internal helpers may be added within the exercise files.
//! Release all internal borrows before switching tasks. Blocking unlock hands
//! ownership directly to the first waiter before making it ready.

// Allow unused items, imports, and parameters in the exercise skeleton.
