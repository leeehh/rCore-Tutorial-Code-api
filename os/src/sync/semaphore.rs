//! Semaphore for the chapter 8 API exercise.
//!
//! Keep the provided types, signatures, and constructor. The two TODOs implement
//! permit acquisition and release, including resource accounting and FIFO
//! blocking. A negative count represents waiting tasks, not negative available
//! resources in the detector. Release internal borrows before switching tasks.

// Allow unused items, imports, and parameters in the exercise skeleton.
