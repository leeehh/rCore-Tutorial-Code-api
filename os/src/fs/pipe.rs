//! Pipes for the chapter 7 API exercise.
//!
//! Keep the provided types, signatures, constructors, and endpoint helpers.
//! Implements the ring buffer, pipe creation, and blocking I/O.
//! Internal helpers may be added within the exercise files.
//!
//! Read and write operate on already translated user buffers. Release the
//! ring-buffer borrow before yielding, and check its state again on resumption.
//! Reads fill the request unless EOF is reached; writes complete the request.
//! Zero-length requests return immediately. Broken-pipe errors and interruption
//! of a waiting operation by signals are outside this exercise's contract.
