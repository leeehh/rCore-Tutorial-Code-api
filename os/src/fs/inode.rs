//! Open-file objects for the chapter 6 API exercise.
//!
//! Each successful open creates an independent offset, while cloning the same
//! `Arc<OSInode>` (including through fork) shares that offset. The underlying
//! easy-fs inode owns file identity and hard-link metadata, not per-open offsets.
//!
//! Syscalls provide checked descriptors and translated user buffers. This layer
//! implements file operations without allocating descriptors or translating user
//! pointers. Internal helpers may be designed freely within the fixed interfaces.

// Allow unused items, imports, and parameters in the exercise skeleton.
