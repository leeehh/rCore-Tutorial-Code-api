//! Process lifecycle and scheduling exercise for chapter 5.
//!
//! The supplied task control blocks, ready queue, and processor state share one
//! representation of each process. Constructors leave tasks ready but not queued;
//! callers enqueue them. A running task is owned by the processor and is absent
//! from the ready queue. Zombies never run again and await parental reaping.
//!
//! Scheduling passes through the processor's idle context on this single core.
//! Release all dynamic borrows before switching; context pointers must remain
//! valid during use. Do not retain temporary owning references on an exited
//! process's abandoned stack, since they would prevent its final reclamation.
//!
//! Internal helper functions may be designed freely within the fixed interfaces.

// Allow unused items, imports, and parameters in the exercise skeleton.
