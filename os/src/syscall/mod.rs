//! System-call dispatch for the chapter 2 API exercise.
//!
//! The single entry point to all system calls, [`syscall()`], is called
//! whenever userspace wishes to perform a system call using the `ecall`
//! instruction. In this case, the processor raises an 'Environment call from
//! U-mode' exception, which is handled as one of the cases in
//! [`crate::trap::trap_handler`].
//!
//! Complete only syscall() here. The write and exit implementations in the
//! submodules, syscall numbers, and public signature are provided. Dispatch
//! forwards arguments and results; trap handling owns the saved user registers
//! and the advancement of sepc. Internal helpers may be added in the two
//! exercise files without changing the provided interfaces.

// The exercise skeleton leaves the dispatch imports and implementations unused.
#![allow(dead_code, unused_imports, unused_variables)]

/// For SYSCALL_EXIT (93), cast args[0] to i32 and call sys_exit; args[1..] are
/// ignored and control never returns because the next application is started.
/// An unsupported ID must panic with the ID, rather than report success or add
/// a new syscall. Do not modify the trap context or advance sepc in this layer.
