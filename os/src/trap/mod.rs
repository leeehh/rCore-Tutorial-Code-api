//! User trap handling for the chapter 2 API exercise.
//!
//! For rCore, we have a single trap entry point, namely `__alltraps`. At
//! initialization in [`init()`], we set the `stvec` CSR to point to it.
//!
//! All traps go through `__alltraps`, which is defined in `trap.S`. The
//! assembly language code saves the user context on the kernel stack and
//! transfers control to
//! [`trap_handler()`].
//!
//! Complete only trap_handler() here. It dispatches user ecalls, terminates
//! applications that cause the supported faults, and diagnoses unsupported
//! traps. This chapter has no timer preemption. Keep init(), TrapContext, and
//! the assembly save/restore path as provided.

// Allow imports and the context parameter to remain in the exercise skeleton.
#![allow(unused_imports, unused_variables)]

/// registers. The exit syscall does not return to this context.
///
/// StoreFault and StorePageFault print the existing PageFault message, then
/// call run_next_app(), which does not return. IllegalInstruction prints the
/// existing IllegalInstruction message and also runs the next application.
/// Do not resume a faulting application or advance its sepc as if it made an
/// ecall. The messages are:
/// `[kernel] PageFault in application, kernel killed it.`
/// `[kernel] IllegalInstruction in application, kernel killed it.`

/// All other causes, including unsupported interrupts, panic with the cause
/// and stval. Do not add scheduling or fault recovery. Application loading,
/// context restoration, and successful shutdown after the last app are provided.
